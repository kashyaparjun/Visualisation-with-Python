    "### Why is visualisation important?\n",
    "Visualisation of data is important for 2 reasons:\n",
    "1. Identification\n",
    "2. Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identification**: It is easier to identify or fine trends with a visual representation. It is much easier than looking at rows and rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication**: Even if an analyst identifies trends/patterns using statistics and just looking at the data, he/she requires a medium of communication that a business person would understand. And, there is no better representation than graphs, plots, nd charts which would convey the findings of an analyst in a better way."
